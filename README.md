# ABOUT  
In this code I implement various computer vision techniques using OpenCV.  
  
It is assumed the OpenCV is installed on your machine and can be linked to at compile time. Code has been tested with openCV 4.3.0.  
More information on openCV can be obtained at:  
https://opencv.org  
  
## I. Color_Conversion:	  
Implementation of various color conversion algorithms using OpenCV.  
  
## II. Color_Conversion_Demo:  
Demonstration of various color conversion algorithms using OpenCV.  
  
## III. Detection Demo:  
Implementation, demonstration and test of algorithms to detect fingers and winking faces in images.  
  
## IV. Image Read:  
Implementation of a program to read in an image and display it using OpenCV.  
  
## V. Image_Threshold:  
Implementation of a program to read in an image and then create a thresholded version of that image  using OpenCV.  
  
## VI. Image_Write:  
Implementation of a program to create a color image, access it using two methods, and then write the image and a grey scale version of the image to files using OpenCV.  
  
## VII. Video_DetectWink:  
Implementation of a program to detect winking faces in video from an attached video camera using OpenCV.  
  
## VIII. Video_Edges:  
Implementation of a program to detect and display edges in a video stream from an attached camera using OpenCV.  
  
## IX. Video_Read:  
Implementation of a program to initialize and display video from the default camera using OpenCV.  
  

# DATA  
Data that can be used as inputs in the various projects can be found in the data directory. The two demo directories have their own data directories.  
  
# COMPILING, INSTALLATION AND RUNNING  
Program files are written in C++ and assume OpenCV can be linked to at compile time.  
  
## Compiling:  
  
Compile scripts are included. Assumes either g++ or Cmake are available.  
  
## How to run the code and a genric run command statement along with an example test cases below the general statement.  
For the non-trivial cases, run scripts are provided to execute compile programs.  
For example, in the case of the Detection_Demo, the script to run the DetectFingers case is:  
./runScript_DetectFingers.bash  
  
## RESULTS  
  
Results are shown in the results folders of the individual directories if they exist.  
  
Results are also sent to the Console.
